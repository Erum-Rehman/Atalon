        para3: `Hong Kong bar owners tinker the rules of traditional beer pong as they realize that it would be more profitable if beer pong games were quicker.`,
        para4: `The biggest innovation is what they call the "double-cherry" rules. If you hit the first cup twice, 6 of the 10 cups are eliminated, which speeds up the game.`,
        para5: `After the first turn is over on a double-cherry rule game, other cup combinations will result in different rewards. One of which is called the "ball in combo" which lets a player eliminate three cups if he/she scored two balls into two different cups during the same turn.`,
        para6: `The rules also include the "first blood." It will let a player eliminate three cups on the opponent side when he/she scored one ball into the front cup on their first turn. The "single cherry" will let a player eliminate four cups after scoring two balls into the same cup (other than the front cup) on his/her first turn`,
