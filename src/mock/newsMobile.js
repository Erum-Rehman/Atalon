        para6: `The rules also include the "first blood." It will let a player eliminate three cups on the opponent side when he/she scored one ball into the front cup on their first turn. The "single cherry" will let a player eliminate four cups after scoring two balls into the same cup (other than the front cup) on his/her first turn`,
